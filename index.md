### CPSC 120

* Lab 1
Lab 1, part 1
This lab signaled the start of my programming adventure. I found it enjoyable thanks to my supportive partner, who helped me get through this lab as it was my first time coding. It laid the foundation for the essential knowledge I applied in subsequent labs.

* Lab 4
Lab 4, part 2
This lab became my favorite due to its engaging concept of creating a game. I appreciated the interactive element of guessing numbers with nested if-else statements. The simplicity and entertainment of the Hi-Lo game, coupled with the learning experience of working extensively with if statements, made it a standout in my coding journey.

* Lab 6
Lab 6, part 2
This lab captivated me by illustrating how code grants an advantage in crafting functional programs, especially evident in the context of Blackjack. This specific coding task felt personal as it required navigating constantly changing variables, marking a significant point in my coding journey. The experience of coding a Blackjack calculation for command line input resonated with my love for the game at family gatherings, and understanding the power of command line arguments added a valuable layer to my coding knowledge.
